    "- Asset: Is what is being protected, it has value to its owner. It can be tangible (Server) or intangible (Data)\n",
    "- Threat: Is the intention to cause damage. For cyber security this can be defined as a hostile act aimed by an attacker at an asset. Regardless of the attacker's intent to do no harm, a threat is still a threat. The attacker posing a threat is commonly called a threat actor.\n",
    "- Vulnerability: Is a defect in a target system. This defect may be a bug in application code, or a flaw in the design of the system. A vulnerabilities can also be a consequence of improper configuration or user action.\n",
    "- Exploit: Is a way to take advantage of a known vulnerability. The usual objective is to take control over the asset. (Social engineering, commonly considered a simple scam, is one kind of exploit.)"
